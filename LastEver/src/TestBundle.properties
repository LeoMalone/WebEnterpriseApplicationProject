rules_text1=The rules as laid out henceforth are to be followed or face penalty of death (okay...maybe not). But we really appreciate it if you follow the rules. They are in place for a reason. Keep everyone safe...<br /><br />
rules_text2=See below for the rules summary.
rules_text3=Click here for Rule Summary

rules_summary_header=Rules Summary
rules_summary_head1=Summary
rules_summary_text1=Unless mentioned otherwise below, league rules will follow FIFA's Laws of the Game.<br />
rules_summary_text2=<br />1.	Field of Play: The Sporting Stadium's soccer pitch dimensions and markings are to be followed.
rules_summary_text3=<br />2.	Duration of Matches: 2 x 25-minute halves with 2 minutes at half time. Teams must be ready to play on time. Any team that is more than 5 minutes late shall forfeit the match. The match will be considered complete if it has been played for more than 35 minutes. No additional time will be added for stoppage or injury time.
rules_summary_text4=<br />3.	Number of Players: Including the goalkeepers, teams must have a minimum of 5 players to start the match, and a maximum of 7 players on the pitch at all times.
rules_summary_text5=<br />4.	Kick-off: Ball may be kicked in any direction. The kick-off is considered to be a direct free kick. Therefore, a goal may be scored directly from a kick-off.
rules_summary_text6=<br />5.	Free Kicks: Direct and Indirect: Opposing players must be 15 feet (5 yards) from the ball in foul situations. 
rules_summary_text7=<br />6.	Kick-in: All kick-ins are indirect. Players will play the ball from out of bounds or on the touch line. All opposing players must be a minimum of 15 feet (5 yards) from the ball. There are no re-kicks if the kick-in doesn't come into play, as the ball is considered to be in play once it is kicked. 
rules_summary_text8=<br />7.	Goal Kick: All goal kicks are direct. Goal kicks can be taken from anywhere within the penalty area.
rules_summary_text9=<br />8.	Penalty Kick: A penalty kick will be awarded as per FIFA law, on the line of the penalty arc at the top of the penalty area, centred between the goal posts.  All players from both teams must be at least 10 feet (3 yards) from the ball and behind the ball before the ball is kicked. The goalkeeper is not allowed to move along the goal line until the ball is kicked (both feet must be stationary before the kick is taken). The ball must move forward.
rules_summary_text10=<br />9.	Caution (Yellow Card): A player who is shown the yellow card will leave the field for two minutes (based on the referee's time), forcing their team to play short handed for that time. If the opposing team scores before the two minutes has expired, the penalty is considered served and the player can return to play.
rules_summary_text11=<br />10.	Dismissal (Red Card): Any player who is shown the red card must leave the facility (may remain in change room) for the duration of the match. The team that receives the red card must play short-handed for the balance of the match. A coach who is ejected from the match must also leave the soccer portion of the facility (may remain in change room) for the duration of the match.
rules_summary_text12=<br />11.	Offside: There is no offside in this league.
rules_summary_text13=<br />12.	Pass-back: Goalkeepers are allowed to handle a ball played deliberately from the foot of a team mate when played directly from a kick-in. If the goalkeeper handles a ball played deliberately from the foot of a team mate (or by means of circumvention) in any other situation, an indirect free kick will be awarded to the attacking team at the top of and outside the penalty area, parallel to where the infringement occurred.
rules_summary_text14=<br />13.	Substitutions: Substitutions are unlimited and may take place at any time including on the fly in all league matches. However, players must substitute within 5 metres of their teams side of the centerline.  An illegal substitution will result in an indirect free kick where the ball was last played and repeated. Disregard of this rule could result in a yellow card.
rules_summary_text15=<br />14.	Slide Tackling: No sliding tackles with feet are permitted (goalkeeper may slide hands first).  An indirect free kick will be awarded to the opposing team (dangerous play). Sliding to save a ball from going out of bounds or in the goal, which does not constitute a tackle or endangering an opposing player in any way, is permitted.
rules_summary_text16=<br />15.	Challenges near touch line: Challenges from the side or behind within 2 yards of the touch line may be penalized, at the referees discretion, as dangerous play against the challenging player. This is done in an attempt to keep players safe from contact with outside walls.
